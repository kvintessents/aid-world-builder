VERBOSE DESCRIPTION OF KARINA 'KRISHA' ELANA:
Body is apparently covered with scales. Large, sharp teeth are in the upper jaw of the reptilian head, and the lower jaw sticks out with a wide tusk-like process. It has only two limbs, with three-toed feet in a 'w' formation. The head is big and round, with small ears, a short snout, and bright yellow eyes. The face is expressionless, with an oversized, tusked upper jaw that sticks out. On the top of its head is a crest of hair, and its ears are small and folded back against its head. It is wearing a dark red, 'Kevlared' type jacket over a red shirt and black trousers. Its boots are nondescript, but sturdy looking, like something you'd see a professional athlete wearing.
It raises an eyebrow at you, and laughs shortly. "So this is your property? Hmmm... it looks like someone was hoping for a fight." It flashes a toothy smile, revealing a row of tiny, sharp teeth. "Then you've gotten yourself a opponent. I'm Karina. Call me whatever you like, sweet cheeks go buy yourself a battleaxe,"
